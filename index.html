        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Redshift is a fundamental concept in astronomy that plays a crucial role in our understanding of the universe. In simple terms, it refers to the shift of light towards longer wavelengths, often observed in astronomical objects. This phenomenon is a key piece of evidence supporting the expansion of the universe and provides valuable insights into its vastness and evolution.

        <h2>Analysis and Discussion</h2>
        <p>
             <br> The Basics of Light: <br> Before delving into redshift, let's grasp the basics of light. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that travels in waves. These waves have various wavelengths, and the range of wavelengths is what we perceive as the spectrum of light. Visible light, the light our eyes can detect, spans a small portion of this spectrum. <br> Wavelength and Frequency: <br> Wavelength is the distance between successive peaks (or troughs) of a wave. Frequency, on the other hand, is the number of wave cycles passing a point per unit of time. In simple terms, wavelength and frequency are inversely related: as one increases, the other decreases. <br> The Doppler Effect: <br> Now, imagine you're standing by a road as a car approaches and then passes you. As the car approaches, you hear a higher-pitched sound, which drops as it moves away. This change in pitch is known as the Doppler effect, and it also applies to light waves. In the context of light, the Doppler effect causes a shift in the observed wavelength and frequency of light from a moving source. If the source is moving towards an observer, the wavelengths shorten, resulting in a blueshift. Conversely, if the source is moving away, the wavelengths lengthen, leading to a redshift. <br> Cosmic Redshift: <br> In the vastness of space, galaxies, stars, and other celestial objects are not stationary; they are in constant motion. When we observe the light emitted by these objects, we can detect a shift towards longer wavelengths, indicating a redshift. The most significant implication of cosmic redshift is its association with the expansion of the universe. Edwin Hubble, an astronomer, played a pivotal role in discovering this correlation. Hubble observed that galaxies farther away from us exhibited larger redshifts, suggesting that the universe is expanding uniformly. <br> The Hubble Law: <br> The relationship between the distance of a galaxy and its redshift is encapsulated in the Hubble Law. This law states that the velocity at which a galaxy is receding from an observer is directly proportional to its distance. In mathematical terms, v = H₀d, where v is the velocity, d is the distance, and H₀ is the Hubble constant. Understanding the Hubble Law is crucial for comprehending the expanding nature of the universe. It implies that galaxies farther away from us are moving away faster, supporting the concept of an expanding cosmos. <br> The Big Bang Connection: <br> Redshift serves as a compelling piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang theory, which proposes that the universe originated from an incredibly hot and dense state approximately 13.8 billion years ago. According to this theory, the universe has been expanding ever since. The cosmic microwave background radiation, a faint glow permeating the universe, is another key aspect linked to the Big Bang. As the universe expanded, this radiation cooled, leaving behind a remnant that can be observed today. The redshift of this radiation aligns with the predictions of the Big Bang theory, providing additional support for this widely accepted cosmological model.
