        <p>
            Redshift is a concept within astronomy that plays a fundamental role in our understanding of the universe. Often observed in astronomical objects, redshift refers to the shift of light towards a longer wavelength. This phenomenon is the key supporting evidence for the expansion of the universe theory and provides valuable insight into its vastness and evolution.

             The Basics of Light
Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that travels in waves. These waves have various wavelengths, and the range of wavelengths varies over a spectrum. Only a small portion is visible to the human eye- the visible light spectrum.

Wavelength and Frequency
Wavelengths are the distance between successive peaks and troughs of a wave. Frequency, on the other hand, is the number of waves passing a point per unit of time. Wavelength and frequency are inversely related; as one increases, the other decreases.

The Doppler Effect
The Doppler effect is ‘the apparent difference between the frequency at which sound or light waves leave a source and that at which they reach an observer, caused by relative motion of the observer and the wave source.’ (Britannica, 2023, Doppler Effect). It is what is used to identify redshift alongside many other distance-related problems. Here is an example of the effect occurring on an object. Imagine you're standing by a road as a car approaches and then passes you. As the car approaches, you hear a higher-pitched sound, which drops as it moves away. This change in pitch is the Doppler effect. In the context of light, ‘If a source of light is moving away from an observer, then a redshift can be observed; conversely, if a source of light is moving toward an observer, a “blueshift” is observed.’ (R. Gray and J. Dunning-Davies, A review of redshift and its interpretation in cosmology and astrophysics)


Cosmic Redshift
The observation of redshift on a cosmic scale largely contributes towards a greater understanding of the universe. In the vastness of space, celestial objects- such as stars and galaxies- are not stationary, they are constantly moving. When we look at the light emitted by these objects, we are able to detect a shift towards longer wavelengths, indicating a redshift. The most significant use of cosmic redshift is its association with the expansion of the universe. Edwin Hubble, an astronomer, played an important role in discovering and establishing this correlation. Hubble observed that galaxies farther away from us exhibited larger redshifts, suggesting that ‘galaxies are receding away from us with a velocity that is proportional to their distance from us’ (Bahcall, N. A. (2015). Hubble’s Law and the expanding universe)

The Hubble Law
The relationship between the distance of a galaxy and its redshift is encapsulated within the Hubble Law. The law states that the velocity at which a galaxy is receding from an observer is directly proportional to its distance. In mathematical terms, v = H₀d, where v is the velocity, d is the distance, and H₀ is the Hubble constant. Understanding the Hubble Law is crucial for getting around the idea of the expanding nature of the universe. It implies that galaxies farther away from us are moving away faster, supporting the concept of an expanding cosmos.

The Big Bang Connection
Redshift serves as a compelling piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang theory, which proposes that the universe originated from an incredibly hot and dense state approximately 13.8 billion years ago. According to this theory, the universe has been expanding ever since. The cosmic microwave background radiation, a faint glow permeating the universe, is another key aspect linked to the Big Bang. As the universe expanded, this radiation cooled, leaving behind a remnant that can be observed today. The redshift of this radiation aligns with the predictions of the Big Bang theory, providing additional support for this widely accepted cosmological model.
